Below is a selection of data science projects demonstrating my end-to-end capabilities, from raw data engineering to statistical modeling and stakeholder presentation.

## 1. Geospatial Solar Optimization Engine {#solar}
**Tools:** Python, `pvlib`, Uber H3, Hexagonal Clustering, Pandas
**Status:** Ongoing Research

### The Challenge
Optimizing solar panel placement in dense urban environments requires balancing irradiation data with spatial constraints. Standard grid models often fail to capture the nuances of irregular urban geometries.

### The Solution
I developed a Python-based optimization engine focusing on the **Kyiv, Ukraine** region. By integrating the `pvlib` library for irradiance modeling with **Uber’s H3** library, I created a hexagonal grid system to identify high-efficiency clusters for photovoltaic installation.

### Key Technical Achievements
* **Hexagonal Spatial Indexing:** Implemented Uber H3 to divide the target area into hexagonal cells, allowing for superior neighbor traversal and radius queries compared to traditional square grids.
* **Irradiance Modeling:** Utilized `pvlib` to simulate clear-sky and actual irradiance based on historical weather data.
* **Location Specificity:** Configured precise geospatial parameters for the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra region to test model sensitivity.

### Code Snapshot
*A snippet demonstrating the initialization of the location and model parameters:*

```python
from pvlib.location import Location
import pvlib
import pandas as pd

# Define specific model parameters for Kyiv region
# Focusing on precise latitude/longitude for irradiation mapping
location = Location(
    latitude=50.4353, 
    longitude=30.5572, 
    tz='Europe/Kyiv', 
    altitude=60, 
    name="Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra"
)

# Fetching clear sky data for model calibration
cs = location.get_clearsky(pd.date_range(start='2024-06-01', periods=24, freq='1H'))
print(cs.head())
