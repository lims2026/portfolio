Below is a selection of data science projects demonstrating my end-to-end capabilities, from raw data engineering to statistical **modeling** and stakeholder presentation.

## 1. Credit Card Customer Segmentation {#credit-card}

![Figure 1: Customer Segments Visualisation](assets/results_credit_card.jpeg){width=80% fig-align="center"}

**Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Kneed
**Status:** Ongoing Research

### The Challenge
Credit card companies struggle to **personalise marketing** or **identify risk** within diverse, unlabelled datasets. The challenge was to uncover **natural customer groupings** using unsupervised learning to reveal hidden **behavioural patterns** and improve retention

### The Solution
A full **unsupervised learning pipeline** was developed to discover meaningful customer segments. The approach included:

* Applying multiple **clustering algorithms**
* Identifying representative **customer profiles** for each segment

This strategy ensured robust segmentation and deeper insight into customer behaviour.

### Key Technical Achievements
* Built a full clustering pipeline (K‑Means, DBSCAN, GMM, HCA) with robust **preprocessing** and **scaling**.
* Identified **K‑Means** as the optimal model (Silhouette Score: 0.32), while detecting that DBSCAN and GMM failed to form distinct clusters on this dataset.
* Evaluated models using **silhouette scores**, **inertia**, PCA **visualisations**, and the **Davies-Bouldin Index**.
* Produced clear customer segments with actionable **business insights**.

### Code Snapshot
*A snippet demonstrating the **initialization** of the location and model parameters:*

```python

#| code-summary: "View Hybrid PCA Code"
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# 1. Retain critical features, that are essential for risk profiling (Ensures interpretability)
direct_features = ['ONEOFF_PURCHASES', 'BALANCE', 'PAYMENTS','CREDIT_LIMIT', 'CASH_ADVANCE']
remaining_features = [col for col in df3.columns if col not in direct_features]

# 2. Apply PCA only to the redundant features
pca = PCA(n_components=6) # Retaining 95% variance
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(scaled_remaining_features)

# 3. Combine critical Features + PCA Components
final_data = np.hstack([scaled_direct_features, principal_components])
final_df = pd.DataFrame(final_data, columns=direct_features + [f'PC{i+1}' for i in range(6)])
```

## 2. Global Rehabilitation Analysis {#global-rehab}
**Tools:** Power BI, SQL, DAX
**Status:** Ongoing Research

### The Challenge
Global health systems lack clear, accessible insight into **rising rehabilitation needs**. Disease burden varies widely across regions and conditions, yet policymakers struggle to interpret complex DALY data and identify where services are most needed. The challenge was to turn **high‑dimensional global health metrics** into clear, trends,and find gaps in the system—through interactive, Power BI dashboards.

### The Solution
Full unsupervised learning pipeline to discover meaningful customer segments. The approach included:

**Extracting and transforming data using SQL.**
**Developing dynamic DAX measures for real-time analysis.**
**Designing user-friendly dashboards for non-technical stakeholders.**

This strategy ensured robust segmentation and deeper insight into customer behaviour.

### Key Technical Achievements
* **Transformed complex health datasets into an intuitive relational data model.**
* **Implemented advanced DAX calculations to quantify disease burden across varying demographics.**
* **Designed interactive visuals (maps, heatmaps) to highlight regional disparities.**
* **Enabled stakeholders to drill into specific conditions and geographies instantly.**

### Power BI Snapshot
*Executive summary with KPIs*
